## Setup & Build

> **Warning**
> Working with batteries of any kind is dangerous. Only continue if you are certain that you know how to use the setup safely. In particular: if there are any deformations, heat, or smoke, disconnect everything immediately and bring the battery outside using a fire-safe container.

For building the hardware kit start by reading both the [Bill of Material](bill-of-materials.md) and the [Build Instructions](build-instructions.md) completely.
